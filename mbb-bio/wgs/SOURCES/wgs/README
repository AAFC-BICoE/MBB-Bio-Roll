These are release notes for Celera Assembler version 8.2, which was released on
November 12th, 2014.

This distribution package provides a stable, tested, documented version of the
software. The distribution is usable on most Unix-like platforms, and some
platforms have pre-compiled binary distributions ready for installation.

The source code package includes full source code (revision r4583), Makefiles,
and scripts. A subset of the kmer package (http://kmer.sourceforge.net/,
revision r1993), used by some modules of Celera Assembler, is included.
This distribution includes SAMtools, Jellyfish 2.0, PBUTGCNS, and parts of
the Falcon assembler.

Full documentation can be found online at http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/.

Whole-Genome Assembly of Drosophila. Science 287 2196-2204]. More recent papers
describe modifications for human genome assembly [Istrail et al. 2004; Levy et
al. 2007], metagenomics assembly [Venter et al. 2004; Rusch et al. 2007],
haplotype separation [Levy et al. 2007; Denisov et al. 2008], a

of 454 data [Miller et al. 2008], and PacBio data [Koren et al. 2013]. There are

Compilation and Installation

Users can download Celera Assembler as source code or as pre-compiled
binaries. The source code package needs to be compiled and installed before it
can be used. The binary distributions need only be unpacked, but they are not
available for all platforms.

To use the source code, execute these commands on any unix-like platform:

  bzip2 -dc wgs-8.2.tar.bz2 | tar -xf -
  cd wgs-8.2
  cd kmer && make install && cd ..
  cd samtools && make && cd ..
  cd src && make && cd ..
  cd ..

To use the binary distributions, choose a platform, download that package, then
unpack it with some unix command like this:

  bzip2 -dc wgs-8.2-*.tar.bz2 | tar -xf -

In both cases, you can run the assembler with:

  wgs-8.2/*/bin/runCA
