Trinity is a Perl-related project and therefore needs particular care for inclusion on the Biocluster.

In summary, the procedure is to extract the source tarball to two distinct directories. Sed commands execute in one of the directories, making changes to perl source files. A patch file is then constructed by comparing the contents of files in the unchanged (orig) directory with the modified files in the other directory. The -orig directory is deleted.

The procedure for patching the source code is (roughly):

## update for env perl
cd SOURCES
tar zxf Trinity-v2.8.4.tar.gz
mv trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4/ trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4-orig/
tar zxf Trinity-v2.8.4.tar.gz
cd trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4/
find ./ -type f -name '*.p?' -exec sed -i -e 's@#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w@#!/usr/bin/env perl@' {} \;
find ./ -type f -name '*.p?' -exec sed -i -e 's@#!/usr/local/bin/perl@#!/usr/bin/env perl@' {} \;
cd ..
diff -ruN trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4-orig/ trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4/  > env-perl.patch
rm -fr wgs-8.3rc2*/
