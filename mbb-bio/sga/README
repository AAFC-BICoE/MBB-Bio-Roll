SGA NEEDS UPDATE

The sga dependency for google-sparsehash is in a transitory state.

google-sparsehash has been renamed to sparsehash and is has been retired by the previous owner, see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparsehash/sparsehash/master/NEWS



all the .pl.patch files provided are for converting hard coded perl interpreter shebang paths to use "!/user/bin/env"
I amalgamated them into one patch with the same method used for the Bio-Roll wgs package.

start by removing old patches, in my case all patches on perl files were to change the shebang line

	rm SOURCES/*.pl.patch

added new patch with Tim Forbes' procedure for patching perl files for shebang paths

	cd SOURCES
	tar xf sga-0.10.15.tar.gz
	mv sga-0.10.15/ sga-0.10.15-orig/
	tar xf sga-0.10.15.tar.gz
	cd sga-0.10.15/

	### the following command was added to the process in order to remove a whitespace from the shebang path
	find ./ -type f -name '*.pl' -exec sed -i -e 's/\s\(\/usr\/bin\/perl\)/\1/' {} \;
	find ./ -type f -name '*.pl' -exec sed -i -e 's/#!\/usr\/bin\/perl/#!\/usr\/bin\/env perl/' {} \;
	find ./ -type f -name '*.pl' -exec sed -i -e 's/#!\/usr\/local\/bin\/perl/#!\/usr\/bin\/env perl/' {} \;
	cd ..
	diff -ruN sga-0.10.15-orig/src sga-0.10.15/src > env-perl.patch
	rm -fr sga-0.10.15*/
